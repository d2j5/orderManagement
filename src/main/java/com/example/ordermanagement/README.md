To run and test this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, select "Open" from the welcome screen or "File" > "Open" from the menu. 
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project, select the root folder, and click "Open".
If you're using Eclipse, select "File" > "Import" from the menu. Expand the "Maven" folder, select "Existing Maven Projects",
and click "Next". Browse to the directory where you cloned the project, select the root folder, and click "Finish".

Run the application:

If you're using an IDE, you can run the application by finding the main class (OrderManagementApplication) and executing it.
The IDE should start the Spring Boot application.

Test the application:

Once the application is running, you can test its functionality using an API testing tool like Postman
(I personally use Postman) or cURL.

Use the following endpoints to interact with the application:

Create an order:
URL: http://localhost:8080/orders
Method: POST
Request body: JSON representation of an order 
(e.g., {"customerName": "Mark Wells", "shippingAddress": "2806 Happy, City", "total": 100.0})
Response: The created order object with an assigned ID and date.

Get all orders:

URL: http://localhost:8080/orders
Method: GET
Response: JSON array containing all the orders in the system.

Get an order by ID:

URL: http://localhost:8080/orders/{id} (replace {id} with the actual order ID)
Method: GET
Response: The order object with the specified ID.
Update an order:
URL: http://localhost:8080/orders/{id} (replace {id} with the actual order ID)

Method: PUT

Request body: JSON representation of the updated order.
Response: The updated order object.

Delete an order:

URL: http://localhost:8080/orders/{id} (replace {id} with the actual order ID)
Method: DELETE
Response: A success message confirming the deletion.
Note: Make sure to replace {id} in the URLs with the actual ID of an order in the database.

Test the validation and exception handling:

You can test the validation and exception handling by sending requests with invalid data or non-existent order IDs.
For example, try creating an order with missing required fields or a negative total value. 
The response should contain error messages indicating the validation errors.

Similarly, try accessing an order with an invalid ID or deleting an order that doesn't exist. 
The response should indicate the corresponding error.

Running the Tests

To run the tests for the Order Management project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have already built the project as mentioned in the previous steps.

Open a terminal or command prompt or just run the test if you are using Intellij.

Navigate to the project's root directory.

Run the following command to execute the tests:
bash

Copy code

mvn test

This command will run all the tests in the project, including both the controller tests (OrderControllerTests)
and the repository tests (OrderRepositoryTests).
After running the tests, you should see the test results in the console. 
The output will indicate whether each test passed or failed.

The OrderControllerTests class tests the functionality of the OrderController class and validates 
the API endpoints and request/response handling.

The OrderRepositoryTests class tests the database operations of the OrderRepository interface, 
such as saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting orders.

The tests use the Mockito framework to mock dependencies and perform unit testing in isolation.

Note: The OrderManagementApplicationTests class is a default test class generated by Spring Boot and can be ignored
in this context.
